    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular way to improve large language models (LLMs). In RAG, documents are retrieved from a database, and then an LLM uses those documents to generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, traditional RAG faces **two challenges**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It retrieves only **local passages** without understanding the broader context.\n",
    "2. It lacks a **global view** of the knowledge across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, Microsoft introduced **GraphRAG**, which integrates **knowledge graphs** with traditional RAG. This approach not only retrieves passages but also uses **structured graph relationships** and **summarizations at multiple levels** (from local details to global insights).\n"

    "* **Community Levels in Summarization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **C0 (Root level):** One broad summary for the entire dataset.\n",

    "  * **C2 summary (Transformers sub-cluster):** “Summarizes research on attention mechanisms, pretraining methods, and fine-tuning for domain adaptation.”\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why it’s critical for Querying:**\n",
